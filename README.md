# Community Website Demo
This repo hosts an AI-generated simple demo version with very limited functionality to give viewers an idea of what the **Blue Steens Commununity** might contain. Don't get hung up on the current design. It's more about getting the sense that this project could really be more than a Google spreadsheet, whether as a website or mobile app.

Refer to https://www.blue-steens.com/community/ for background on this project.

If you'd like to submit any suggestions for the registry, complete the [short questionnaire](https://forms.gle/FzpyBu7cZN8Pd3rKA).
